                <p class="text-justify">Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free
                  society,
                  transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how
                  citizens hold
                  their public officials
                  accountable.
                  Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the
                  public business
                  and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows
                  good
                  and just
                  governance.
                  Transparency promotes
                  accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement
                  enhances the
                  Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
                  society, and
                  public officials benefit
                  from having
                  access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in
                  American
                  government.

              <div class="card-body">
                <p class="text-justify">In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and
                  susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many
                  philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state
                  secrecy, a
                  core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end
                  can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
                  Swedish-governed territory) enacting
                  free
                  press
                  legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of
                  the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
                  public sphere.

                  <p class="text-justify">Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and
                    France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
                    accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional
                    articles. In the
                    nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were
                    vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton
                    prominent among the latter.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
                    democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation.
                    Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of
                    information
                    legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland
                    continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
                    Publicity of Official Documents in 1951
                    (superseded
                    by new legislation in 1999).</p>

                  <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                    Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
